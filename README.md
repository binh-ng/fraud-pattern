## Project Abstract
Fraud has become a critical issue in Canada, affecting individuals, businesses, and the economy significantly. This project investigates fraud patterns and their impact in Canada, focusing on trends, geography, demographics, and financial losses from 2021 to 2024. The insights derived aim to inform effective strategies for mitigating fraud and its consequences.

The analysis utilized **Python** and implemented libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly**. Key methodologies included time series analysis to identify fraud trends, geographic analysis to locate hotspots, demographic analysis by age and gender, and financial analysis to understand losses by fraud type. The results revealed distinct patterns, including periodic fraud peaks (every 12 weeks), regional disparities in fraud distribution, and demographic variations in victimization.

## Repository Description
This repository contains:
+ `fraud_analysis.ipynb` - Python notebook detailing the analysis process, including time series modelling, geographic analysis, and financial insights.
+ `fraud_data.csv` - Dataset sourced from the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, containing records of fraud incidents, demographics, and financial losses.
+ `visualizations/` - Directory containing static and interactive visuals, including fraud trend plots and heatmaps.
+ `fraud_report.pdf` - Final report summarizing findings and recommendations.
